### Technical details

<!--
To check if a vendor uses an ecommerce platform, navigate to the vendor's website, then open your browser's dev tools (Ctrl + Shift + I or Cmd + Shift + I). Search the page's HTML for the name of the ecommerce platform, e.g. Shopify. If results are found, this almost certainly means that the vendor uses this platform. You can also check page footers to see if an ecommerce platform is mentioned.
-->
<!--
Vendors using Shopify can be more easily integrated using the Shopify Storefront API
 -->

Does the vendor use **Shopify**? [Yes/No]
If not, does the vendor use **any other ecommerce platform**? [e.g., Woocommerce, BigCommerce]

Generally, the support of 10 users is necessary for a vendor to be considered, but the required level is subject to teafor.me's discretion.
